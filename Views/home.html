        <h1>Statement of Faith</h1>
        <p>God&apos;s gospel originates in and expresses the wondrous perfections of the eternal, triune God. </p>
        <p>
            God&apos;s gospel is authoritatively revealed in the Scriptures.<br/>
            God&apos;s gospel alone addresses our deepest need.<br/>
            God&apos;s gospel is made known supremely in the Person of Jesus Christ.<br/>
            God&apos;s gospel is accomplished through the work of Christ.<br/>
            God&apos;s gospel is applied by the power of the Holy Spirit.<br/>
            God&apos;s gospel is now embodied in the new community called the church.<br/>
            God&apos;s gospel compels us to Christ-like living and witness to the world.<br/>
            God&apos;s gospel will be brought to fulfillment by the Lord Himself at the end of this age.<br/>
            God&apos;s gospel requires a response that has eternal consequences.<br/>
